      <subsection name="What is HST Spring Security Support?">
        <p>
          <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/" target="_blank">Spring Security</a>
          is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          HST Spring Security Support project provides seamless integration with Spring Security for HST-2 SITE applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mainly, HST Spring Security Support project provides the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An Authentication Provider which allows authentication against users and groups stored in the Hippo Repository.
            <br/>
            See the <a href="http://hst-springsec.forge.onehippo.org/apidocs/org/onehippo/forge/security/support/springsecurity/authentication/HippoAuthenticationProvider.html">Javadoc of HippoAuthenticationProvider</a> for details.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Spring Security Valve in order to translate Spring Security Authentication to an HST-2 aware Subject.
            <br/>
            See the <a href="http://hst-springsec.forge.onehippo.org/apidocs/org/onehippo/forge/security/support/springsecurity/container/SpringSecurityValve.html">Javadoc of SpringSecurityValve</a> for details.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because Spring Security provides a lot of out-of-box security integration solutions such as HTTP Basic/Digest authentication,
          LDAP, Form-based, Open ID, JA-SIG CAS authentication, you can take advantage of those with HST-2!
