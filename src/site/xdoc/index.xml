      <subsection name="What is HST Spring Security Support?">
        <p>
          <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/" target="_blank">Spring Security</a>
          is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          HST Spring Security Support project provides seamless integration with Spring Security for HST-2 SITE applications.
          Mainly, HST Spring Security Support project provides an authentication provider against Hippo Repository and
          a Spring Security aware Security Valve in order to let you leverage Spring Security instead of the default
          JAAS based security module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Spring Security provides a lot of out-of-box security integration solutions such as HTTP Basic/Digest authentication,
          LDAP, Form-based, Open ID, JA-SIG CAS authentication, you can take advantage of those with HST-2!
