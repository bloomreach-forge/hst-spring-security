          You can check out, build and run the demo application like the following:
        </p>
        <div class="brush: bash">
        <source><![CDATA[
$ svn co https://forge.onehippo.org/svn/hst-springsec/hst-springsec-demo/trunk hst-springsec-demo
$ cd hst-springsec-demo
$ mvn clean package

        <ul>
          <li>
            By default, you cannot navigate any page except of login form page without authentication.
            Please refer to the configuration in /WEB-INF/applicationContext-security.xml for the access configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you sign in by admin/admin, then you will be able to navigate all the pages.
            However, if you sign in by editor/editor, then you will be able to navigate all the pages except of '/site/about' page
            because the /about sitemap item is configured with 'hst:authenticated' = true and 'hst:roles' = [ 'ROLE_admin' ] in the demo.
            When you visit '/site/about' after signing in by editor/editor, you will get an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403">HTTP 403</a> error.
          </li>
        </ul>
