    <section name="Configuring Apache HTTPd">
      <subsection name="Introduction">
        <p>
          When you run your SITE web application as a non-ROOT web application (with a non-empty context path like '/site')
          behind an Apache HTTP Server, if you want to map root context path to your SITE web application path
          (e.g, '/**' -> '/site/**' and vice versa), then you should take a careful look at the reverse proxy and rewriting configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike HST-2 container itself, Spring Security Framework is very sensitive to the servlet context path.
          Therefore, you have to put additional HTTPd configurations for your spring-security enabled HST-2 site web application.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Configuring Rewriting and Reverse Proxy">
        <p>
          When you run your SITE web application as a non-ROOT web application behind an Apache HTTP Server,
          you will probably have configurations like the following example
          (Ref: <a href="https://www.onehippo.org/library/deployment/configuring/configure-apache-httpd-as-reverse-proxy-for-hippo.html" target="_blank">Configure Apache httpd web server for site(s)</a>):
        </p>
        <div class="brush: xml">
        <source><![CDATA[
<VirtualHost  *:80>
  ServerName www.example.com
  ServerAlias *.example.com

  ProxyPreserveHost  On
  ProxyPass  / http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/
  ProxyPassReverse  / http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/
  ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  /site /
</VirtualHost>
        ]]></source>
        </div>
        <p>
          The configuration shown above is not good enough with Spring Security Framework
          because Spring Security Framework always redirects to a login page URL with prepending it with the context path (e.g, '/site').
          Then, the request is redirected to '/site/login.jsp' for instance, which actually results in http://127.0.0.1/site/site/login.jsp in the end.
          This could lead to an infinite redirction when you set the login page URL to '/login.jsp' as a context relative path in Spring Security Framework configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, one solution would be to add a redirection rule to redirect /site/** to /* forcefully like the following example:
        </p>
        <div class="brush: xml">
        <source><![CDATA[
<VirtualHost  *:80>

  # -->8--SNIP -->8--

  # Rewrite security requests by Spring Security, since Spring Security is context-aware
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^/site/(.*)$ /$1 [R=301]

  # -->8--SNIP -->8--

</VirtualHost>
        ]]></source>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the example above, using the RewriteRule combined with a 301 redirection, you can secure your website,
          while still reverse-proxying your Spring Security enabled web application correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a full configuration example with the rewriting rule and reverse proxy configurations:
        </p>
        <div class="brush: xml">
        <source><![CDATA[
<VirtualHost  *:80>
  ServerName www.example.com
  ServerAlias *.example.com

  # Rewrite security requests by Spring Security, since Spring Security is context-aware
  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^/site/(.*)$ /$1 [R=301]

  ProxyPreserveHost  On
  ProxyPass  / http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/
  ProxyPassReverse  / http://127.0.0.1:8080/site/
  ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  /site /
</VirtualHost>
        ]]></source>
        </div>

      <subsection name="Alternative to Apache HTTPd Rewriting Rules Configuration">
        <p>
          In the previous section, we used RewriteRule with mod_rewrite module in Apache HTTP Server.
          If you want to manage the rewriting rules at runtime or manage all the rewriting rules in a central location managed
          by Hippo Repository, then you can consider using 
          <a href="https://www.onehippo.org/library/concepts/plugins/url-rewriter/about.html" target="_blank">URL Rewriter Plugin</a>
          instead of RewriteRule backed by mod_rewrite module.
