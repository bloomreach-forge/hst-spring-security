# HST Spring Security Support

[Spring Security](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/) is a powerful and highly customizable authentication
and access-control framework.

**HST Spring Security Support** project provides seamless integration with Spring Security for HST-2 based applications.

Mainly, **HST Spring Security Support** project provides the following:

- An Authentication Provider which allows authentication against users and groups stored in the Hippo Repository.
  See the Javadoc of [```org.onehippo.forge.security.support.springsecurity.authentication.HippoAuthenticationProvider```](src/main/java/org/onehippo/forge/security/support/springsecurity/authentication/HippoAuthenticationProvider.java).
  for details.
- A Spring Security Valve in order to translate Spring Security Authentication to an HST-2 aware Subject.
  See the Javadoc of [```org.onehippo.forge.security.support.springsecurity.container.SpringSecurityValve```](src/main/java/org/onehippo/forge/security/support/springsecurity/container/SpringSecurityValve.java) for details.

Because Spring Security provides a lot of out-of-box security integration solutions such as HTTP Basic/Digest authentication, LDAP, Form-based, Open ID, JA-SIG CAS authentication, you can take advantage of those with HST-2!
